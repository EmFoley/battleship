# Battleship Game 

Two-player battleship game. Players log in from separate browsers and compete against one another in traditional battleship boardgame rules. Each player starts with five ships of varying lengths, and can view his or her own board. Players take turns launching missiles at their opponent, randomly hitting either ships or water until one player's ships have all been sunk.
